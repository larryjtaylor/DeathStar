## Description

_The app is a "human resources" database for the Death Star. The database is pre-loaded with immutable divisions, departments, and high command structure. Users are able to add and edit personnel from officer level down. Users will also be able to assign officers to multiple departments, as well as delete the personnel entry. Personnel are added with name, species, rank, pay, and record attributes. The app can display a global personnel roster with each entry's department. There is also a fun job-board page, enjoy!_
